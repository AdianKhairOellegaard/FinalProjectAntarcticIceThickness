# FinalProjectAntarcticIceThickness
# Project Title

This is the github for Adian Khair Oellegaard, Jens Gorm Rytter, Markus Bligaard Winther, Phillip Nordfang, Silas Larsen. Here, we can structure and connect our work.

## Description
This Github is for the Applied Machine Learning 2025- Antarctic ice sheet ice thickness project. A parquet datafile of different icesheet thickness measurements along with other features is made in the create_bedmap_dataset.ipynb file. Our ML models should be compared to the glaciological model BedMachine v3.7 which's thickness predictions are given in the datafile in the column: 'ith_bm'.

(Note: The datafile is called bedmap_train.parquet is 6.9 GB which is why I have not uploaded it to github yet. The same for the datafiles that bedmap_train.parquet is generated from.
## Getting Started

If you want to to hook up the repository direclty to a folder:
In folder for final project:

git clone https://github.com/AdianKhairOellegaard/FinalProjectAntarcticIceThickness.git

git pull

Adding/updating files:

git add <filename>
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push

(Ask ChatGPT (or someone in the group) if you get stuck)


Alternatively you can just download and add files to the repositry through a browser with the link: https://github.com/AdianKhairOellegaard/FinalProjectAntarcticIceThickness.git
### Dependencies

* Prerequisites for running the code should be written in requirements.txt
